          <h3>What are Iron Man's powers?</h3>
          <p> 
            Iron Man possesses a wealth of powers through his powered armor suit.
            These powers include super strength, the ability to fly, durability, and a number of weapons. <br>
            The primary weapons used by Iron Man are rays that are shot from the palms of his gauntlets

          <h3>Who is Iron man and how did he get his power?</h3>
          <p>
            Iron Man gets his superpowers from his metallic suit of armor and other technologies invented by his alter ego Tony Stark. <br>
            Tony is a genius engineer and wealthy owner of a technology company. Tony built the Iron Man suit when he was kidnapped and suffered an injury to his heart. <br> 
            The suit was meant to save his life and help him escape. Tony also has an improved artificial nervous system which gives him greater healing powers, super perception, and the ability to merge with his suit of armor. Outside of his armor he has been trained in hand-to-hand combat.

          <div class="movie-container">
            <p class="movie-item">
              The reckless Thor, son of Odin, challenges his brother Loki's claim to the throne of Asgard. To teach him humility, Odin casts the young warrior down to Earth to live amongst humans. Robbed of his powers, Thor falls in love with scientist Jane Foster. While Loki usurps the throne of Asgard for evil gain and plans revenge, Thor's love for Jane and his lessons of humility turn him into the true hero and legendary and immortal warrior-defender of the people of the Earth, saving them from destruction.

          <div class="movie-container">
            <p class="movie-item">
              There are nine realms of Asgard, and once every five thousand years, they align. Earth happens to be one of these realms. These realms create portals between the worlds during the alignment which is called "Convergence". On Earth, in London, England, Jane Foster believes she and her crew have discovered one such portal. Foster, while investigating the phenomenon, is transported to another realm and comes in contact with a substance called the Aether. Upon coming into contact with the substance, it draws Thor from Asgard back to Earth. Thor takes Jane to Asgard to be cured from the Aether. Unfortunately, in doing so, it draws more than just Jane to that world. Another being called Malekith wants to use the Aether to destroy Asgard. Devising a plan with his brother, the war criminal Loki, Thor heads to "The Dark World" to destroy the Aether and save Asgard.
